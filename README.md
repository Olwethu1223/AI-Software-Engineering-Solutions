## 🔥 Bonus Task: Innovation Challenge – DocuBot

As part of the bonus challenge, our group proposed **DocuBot**, an AI-powered tool that generates technical documentation from source code using NLP.

This complements our main project by automating a time-consuming software task and aligns with the theme of intelligent software solutions.
