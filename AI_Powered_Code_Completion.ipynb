The Copilot version uses Python's built-in sorted() function with a lambda as the key function, which is concise and leverages Python's optimized sorting algorithm (Timsort). This approach has O(n log n) time complexity, typical for comparison-based sorting, with O(n) space complexity for creating the new sorted list.\n",

        "The manual implementation follows the \"decorate-sort-undecorate\" pattern (Schwartzian transform). While also O(n log n) in time complexity, it creates intermediate data structures (the decorated list), making it slightly less memory efficient than the Copilot version. The manual version performs three operations: list comprehension for decoration, in-place sort, and another list comprehension for undecoration.\n",
